\section{CVaR model}\label{sec:CVaR}

The CVaR model was built based on the first set of scenarios with start date 2008-02-27, obtained from scenario generaion chapter. Based on this set is determined the value and expected value of each ETF $i$, for each scenario $s$. In addition, is considered a initial budget of 1 million kr. The CVaR model is defined as
\begin{align}
\sum_{i} x_{i} &= \up{Budget} \\
\up{MeanReturn} &\ge \mu_{\up{Target}} \up{Budget} \\
\up{VaRDev}_{s} &\ge \up{Losses}_{s} - \up{VaR} \; \; \forall s \\
\up{Losses}_{s} &= \sum_{i} x_{i} - \sum_{i} \up{P}_{i,s} x_{i} \; \; \forall s \\
\up{CVaR} &= \up{VaR} + \frac{1} {1 - \alpha} \sum_{s} \up{pr}_{s} \up{VaRDev}_{s} \\
\up{MeanReturn} &= \sum_{i} \up{EP}_{i} x_{i}
\end{align}
where $ \mu_{\up{Target}}$ is 0, $\up{P}_{i,s}$ is the value of each ETF $i$ by scenario $s$, $\up{pr}_{s}$ is the probability of each scenario $s$ and is assumed to be linearly distributed over the scenarios, $\up{EP}_{i}$ is the expected value for each ETF $i$, and $\alpha$ is assumed to be 0.5.
In order to obtain the efficient frontier based on 10 optimal solutions of CVaR model is neccesary to find the minimum CVaR solution, as well as the CVaR solution related to the maximum possible return. Minimizing the model in order to CVaR variable, it returns the minimum CVaR solution of efficient frontier. Maximizing the model in order to MeanReturn variable, it returns the CVaR solution for the maximum average return. Based on this extreme points, a linear $\up{CVaR}_{\up{Target}}$ is created for the 10 runs. A constraint for limit the space solution movement to the $\up{CVaR}_{\up{Target}}$ is included in the CVaR model, and is defined as
\begin{align}
\up{CVaR} &\le \up{CVaR}_{\up{Target}} 
\end{align}
For each of the 10 runs, the CVaR model is optimized in order to maximize the MeanReturn variable. The efficient frontier of the 10 optimal solutions is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:frontier}. 






A CVaR bound of 0.0 indicates that CVaR is minimal, with 1.0 indicating that the optimization solely considers mean return.
