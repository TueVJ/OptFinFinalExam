\section{Data download and clustering analysis}

Price data on the ETFs is downloaded from Google Finance using the data download functionality built in to the Pandas module for Python.
We use the closing price of the ETF for each day to represent the day's price.
Any ETF with less than 2400 data points is excluded, leaving 93 of the initial 100 ETFs to use for further processing.
